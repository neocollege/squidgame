Squid Game is a popular Netflix TV Show that came out in 2021 and took the world by storm. The show is centred around a competition called ‘Squid Game’, which consists of multiple rounds and the winner wins a certain amount of money. 
The game is played by players who get eliminated in each round. Not just eliminated, killed. The enforcers maintain the rules of the game and kill players if they lose. The organisers can add new players or delete players.
Our project is based off this system and helps the players, enforcers and organisers view and update information into the system.
